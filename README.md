# Parcel
 - Zero config

 # Dev server 
  Parcel includes a development server out of the box. Just run parcel index.html to get started.i.e local host 1234

# Hot reloading  (HMR) Hot Module Refresher
    When you make a change, Parcel automatically updates your code in the browser – no page reload necessary!

 # Diagnostics
  If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.

 # Reliable caching
  Everything Parcel does is cached – transformation, dependency resolution, bundling, optimizing, and everything in between. This means the dev server restarts instantly, and the same code is never built twice.

 # Tree shaking
 Parcel supports tree-shaking both ES modules and CommonJS out of the box! It statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used.its doesnt excutes the not used functions in ur code

 # Minification 
 Parcel includes minifiers for JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and SVG out of the box! Just run parcel build index.html, and your whole application will be built and optimized automatically.

 # Image optimization
 # Compression

 -Differential bundling
 When you use <script type="module">, Parcel automatically generates a nomodule fallback for old browsers as well, depending on your browser targets.
